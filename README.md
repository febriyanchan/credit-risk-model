Credit Risk Prediction Model
This repository contains an end-to-end credit risk prediction model built using machine learning. The project is part of my final internship assignment at ID/X Partners.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the risk of loan applicants. The dataset consists of both approved and rejected loan applications, allowing for a comprehensive risk evaluation.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends and patterns in the dataset.

Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing machine learning models to predict credit risk.

Deployment Script: Code for model inference and integration into a pipeline.

Presentation Infographics: Summary visuals for project insights.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)

Jupyter Notebook & .py scripts

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
